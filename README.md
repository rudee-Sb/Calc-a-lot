# Calc-a-lot

A versatile web page featuring standard, scientific, and programmer calculators using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Standard Calculator : Performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Progammer Calculator : Converts values between different numeral systems (binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal)
- Dropdown Menu: Easily switch between different calculators using a dropdown menu in the header.
- Easy to use : Intuitive interface designed for quick access to all calculator functionalities.

## Planned Features

- **Scientific Calculator**: Coming soon! Will handle advanced functions like trigonometry and logarithms.

## How It Works

This calculator webpage utilizes JavaScript's Math.js library to perform various calculations efficiently. The **evaluate** function from Math.js is employed for standard calculations, allowing users to input mathematical expressions that are parsed and computed seamlessly. 

For instance, users can enter expressions like `2 + 3 * sqrt(4)`, and the evaluate function will return the correct result based on mathematical precedence.

In addition to standard calculations, the webpage features a programmer calculator that leverages JavaScript's built-in functions like `parseInt()` and `toString()`. The `parseInt()` function converts strings in different bases (e.g., binary, octal, hexadecimal) into decimal values, while `toString()` allows users to convert decimal values back into various bases. This dual functionality makes it easy for users to switch between different numeral systems, enhancing the calculator's versatility.
